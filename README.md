# One of my first-ever projects made on React
I learned how to use Firebase, useState, useEffect, useContext, etc. while creating this project. This project was a huge game-changer at the beginning of my programming career as I grew 3x in skill once I finished this.

To install dependencies, run:
```
npm install
```

To run the application at your local browser:
```
npm run start
```
